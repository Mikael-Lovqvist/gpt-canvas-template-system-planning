**Project Plan Outline for MVP**

### 1. **Project Scope Overview**
   - **Goal**: Create a generic template processor that is not tied to any specific language. The processor will be built using a framework that provides the necessary support, such as mnemonic tree language, record management, conditional dispatching, and introspection features.

### 2. **Layered Project Specification**
   - **Layer 1 - High-Level Vision**: The end goal is to develop a generic template processor capable of handling templates in a flexible way, independent of specific languages or platforms.
   - **Layer 2 - Framework Details**: The framework includes:
     - **Mnemonic Tree Language**: Used to define the structure and rules of the template language.
     - **Record Management**: Manages data records utilized during template processing.
     - **Conditional Dispatching**: Handles conditions and dispatches functions or processes as needed.
     - **Custom Types and Introspection**: Supports defining custom types and debugging features to facilitate development.
   - **Layer 3 - Template Processor Features**:
     - **Tokenization and Parsing**: Define how templates are tokenized and parsed using the mnemonic tree language.
     - **Rendering**: Implement efficient template rendering based on parsed structures.
   - **Layer 4 - MVP Features and Dependencies**:
     - **Essential MVP Features**: Tokenization, parsing, rendering engine.
     - **Dependencies**: Ensure the framework components, such as record management and conditional dispatching, are functional to support the template processor.

### 3. **Existing Components**
   - **Core Features Developed**: List the features that are currently implemented or in progress.
   - **Current Architecture**: Provide an overview of the system architecture as it exists today, including major components like databases, APIs, or modules.
   - **Known Dependencies**: Highlight existing dependencies, both internal (e.g., between modules) and external (e.g., third-party services).

### 4. **Missing Components**
   - **Core Features Yet to Be Developed**: Identify the critical features that are currently missing for the MVP.
   - **Infrastructure Needs**: What technical infrastructure (e.g., server setup, deployment environments) do you still need?
   - **Technical Debt and Gaps**: Any unresolved technical issues or shortcuts that need to be addressed.

### 5. **Prioritization and Feature Breakdown**
   - **MVP Features**: List the features that are essential for the MVP. Identify "must-haves" versus "nice-to-haves."
   - **Dependencies and Order**: Create a dependency graph or simple list of tasks that must be completed before others can start.

### 6. **Plan to Address Gaps**
   - **Feature Implementation Plan**: Assign each feature to a sprint or phase of the development cycle.
   - **Research and Prototyping**: Note any areas where further research or prototyping is needed before development can proceed.

### 7. **Timelines and Milestones**
   - **Development Timeline**: Create a rough timeline for completing the remaining work.
   - **Milestones**: Identify key milestones along the way, such as "Basic UI Complete," "Core API Functional," or "Initial User Testing."

### 8. **Risks and Challenges**
   - **Potential Challenges**: Note any anticipated challenges in technology, dependencies, or timelines.
   - **Mitigation Strategies**: Develop strategies to mitigate these risks.

### 9. **Next Steps**
   - **Immediate Tasks**: Outline what needs to happen next to move forward.
   - **Team Assignments**: If you have a team, assign tasks or identify roles that need to be filled.
