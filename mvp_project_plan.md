**MVP Project Plan**

### 1. **Project Overview**
The purpose of this project is to develop a generic template processor that operates independently of any specific language. This template processor will utilize a framework that handles most of the core operations, including parsing, dispatching, and rendering templates. The framework offers a mnemonic tree language, which is used to define the template language, tokenizers, and parsers.

The framework also manages records, conditional dispatching, custom types, and offers various introspection and debugging features. A key aspect of the project is ensuring that these components are layered properly, allowing for easy extension, modularity, and effective handling of dependencies.

### 2. **Layered Specifications**
The project is divided into layers to provide a structured approach:
   - **Core Layer**: Handles the fundamental operations, including tokenization, parsing, and initial AST construction. This layer is built using generic types and interfaces.
   - **Template Processing Layer**: Uses the core layer to build the template processing capabilities, including AST transformation, inline expression handling, and regulation-based dispatching.
   - **Rendering Layer**: Focuses on transforming the AST into the final output. This layer involves rendering dispatchers, which evaluate statements and inline expressions.
   - **User Extension Layer**: Allows users to define their own template language variations or extend the existing template language to suit specific needs.

### 3. **Scope and Prioritization**
The project scope is focused on achieving a functional MVP that can perform template processing, with the following prioritized features:
   1. **Basic Template Parsing**: Parsing of text into a tree-like structure, with support for both fixed content and template statements.
   2. **Conditional Dispatching**: Implementing dispatchers to handle the parsed template nodes, utilizing rules defined by regulations.
   3. **Rendering**: Converting the parsed AST into the final output using rendering dispatchers, including handling of inline expressions and statements.
   4. **Factory-based Type Creation**: Introducing factories for creating types based on records and interfaces, enabling modularity and adaptability.
   5. **Introspection and Debugging Tools**: Providing introspection capabilities to help understand the structure of the AST and assist in debugging during template processing.

### 4. **Key Design Formalities**
   - **Factories for Type Creation**: To maintain modularity and ensure ease of extension, the project will use factories for creating concrete types from records and interfaces. This approach allows for easy substitution and testing of individual components.
   - **Mnemonic Tree Language**: The template language is defined using a mnemonic tree language, where text is structured by indentation, similar to YAML or Python. This allows for an intuitive representation of nested templates.
   - **Dispatchers and Regulations**: The dispatcher system is used extensively for both parsing and rendering. Regulations consist of rules that determine how each node in the template tree should be processed or rendered.

### 5. **Future Considerations**
   - **Edge Case Handling**: For now, the focus is on well-formed templates. Future iterations will include validation mechanisms to handle edge cases, such as malformed templates or unsupported constructs.
   - **Optimizations**: Performance optimizations, such as caching rendered content and using LUT-based regulations for fast lookups, will be addressed in future versions.

### 6. **Summary**
The MVP focuses on building a generic template processor with a strong foundation in modularity, extensibility, and structured dispatching. The use of mnemonic tree language, layered architecture, and factory-based type creation are key to achieving a flexible and scalable solution.
